## 🤖 How AI Insights Work

The AI analyzes your productivity data using 12 rules:

1. **Working Time Pattern** - Detects if you're a morning/evening person
2. **Missed Deadlines** - Alerts on deadline issues
3. **Focus Time** - Monitors deep work time
4. **Completion Rate** - Tracks task finishing efficiency
5. **Productivity Streak** - Celebrates consistency
6. **Task Overload** - Prevents overwhelm
7. **Procrastination** - Identifies delayed tasks
8. **Work-Life Balance** - Monitors weekend work
9. **Priority Pattern** - Ensures focus on important tasks
10. **Consistency** - Tracks week-over-week progress
11. **Burnout Risk** - Detects overwork
12. **Task Size** - Suggests breaking down large tasks

All analysis happens locally in your browser - no data is sent anywhere!
